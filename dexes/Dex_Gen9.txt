What is this?


First of all, THIS PROJECT IS UNOFFICIAL HOMEBREW!! The devs of PTU do not officially endorse this Gen 9 conversion over any others, and they are unlikely to be familiar with the ideas and principles utilized within. The creators of this conversion are credited below.


More specifically, This Dex aims to transport all of the Generation 9 Pokemon to Pokemon Tabletop United, a fan-created Pokemon tabletop role-playing game.
All of these should be playable from the start, including Legendaries and the new Paradox forms. (Bosses should be made by GMs separately.)
This entails rewriting their movelists so they get Moves of their Type and attacking Stat beginning at early Levels. To this end, new Moves were also added where necessary, for example there weren’t any physical Fairy Moves besides Play Rough, which you really can’t hand out at Lv5.
New Abilities to make some Evolution lines more fun and unique were also homebrewed.


How to Use (DO NOT SKIP!)
Playing PTU comes with its own caveats and stipulations which players and GMs should be aware of, so it’s recommended to follow all guidelines presented in the #ptu-resources channel of the official PTU Discord. In addition, the rules on TM-, Tutor-, and Eggmoves have been changed below. And for the inclined, there are more houserules suggested in the Appendix.


This project was also created with the assumption that Domovoi’s rework of Dragon Moves is in use, which allows Dragons to hit Super-Effectively under certain conditions. His rework can be found here. Whenever a Move or Effect is mentioned both in this Document and there, Domo’s rework takes precedent.
If you’re not using these Move Reworks, consider ignoring the clauses in the new Dragon Moves which grant conditional SE for the sake of balance.


Brief Note on Maushold & Dudunsparce
Yes, there’s special Forms for these two. No, they do not have (or need) special rules. A GM may rule them as “shinies” and come up with their own, though.


The Inspiration: Pokémon Odyssey
Pokémon Odyssey is a tabletop RPG different from PTU, that is currently Work-in-Progress, with a focus on grid-based tactical combat first and foremost and a strong split between tactical combat and narrative play as separate play modes.
Our Gen 9 project right here is pretty much in effort of keeping PTU rolling until Odyssey releases. We took a great deal of inspiration from its playtesting material. (You can notice that the most with the Abilities Armor Tail, Noble Steed, Tower Shield, and Good as Gold) We greatly recommend you check it out and stay tuned for what’s coming! Any info can be found in the official PTU Discord’s Odyssey-related channels.
Rules Change: TM, Tutor, and Egg Moves
All of these Movelists were unified into one list per Pokémon in this Dex. On one hand since they never practically differed in usage in PTU in the first place, on the other since the Tutor Lists would have been largely empty anyways because of how TMs were restructured in Generation 9.
This means the following for teaching Moves:
* This unified list simultaneously functions as TM, Tutor, and Egg Move List. Any Moves on it may both be learned through a Tutor, or via TM.
* No Matter the method these were learned by (if via TM, an NPC Mentor, or a Player Mentor’s Feature), they all cost 1 Tutor Point to teach, regardless of what TP cost would have been attached to the given method in PTU Core.
* If any of these Moves is forgotten, the corresponding Tutor Point is refunded.
* Moves that are on the Level Up Move List of a Pokémon may also be learned via the other Methods. They were not repeated in the TM/Tutor List, to save space. Keep in mind that they don’t count as Natural Moves until the level is reached at which they would have been learned naturally!
* You may retroactively apply this change to all Pokémon from previous Dexes, if your playgroup so desires.
Also, reminder that the Tutor Move Restrictions from the September 2015 Errata are official.
________________


New Capabilities


Breathless (from Data’s Homebrews): This Pokémon has no need to breathe, generally due to being inanimate in some way. It has no risk of suffocation in water, space, or other airless environments, though this does not render it resistant or immune to any Moves or Abilities.


Intoxicator: The Pokémon’s struggle Attacks may be Poison-Typed if they wish. They may also add their Special Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish.
If a Pokémon learns Acid Spray, Barb Barrage, Dire Claw, Poison Fang, Poison Jab, Poison Sting, Poison Tail, Shell Side Arm, Sludge, Sludge Bomb, or Smog and does not have the Intoxicator Capability, they gain Intoxicator.
NOTE: Any homebrew Poison Moves you create, that are of an EOT or At-Will Frequency and cannot hit multiple targets (through an Area of Effect or the Pass keyword etc.), should also grant this Capability.
	

Lifesense: Pokémon with the Lifesense Capability can sense the location of living creatures within up to 5 meters. This Capability does not apply against Ghost-Type Pokémon or those with the Dead Silent Capability.


Scavenger: Once per day during an Extended Rest or as an Extended Action, the user may roll 1d20 and consult the Pickup Table to see what item they gain.
NOTE: When homebrewing, feel free to retroactively grant this Capability to any Pokémon in previous generations capable of taking Pickup as an Ability.
	

Split Evolution (from Data’s Homebrews): This Pokémon has more than one Evolution. When it evolves, it may choose which of its immediate evolutions it wants to evolve into, provided it meets any other requirements.


Tera Shift: The user is generally in Terastal form. The user may exit this form outside of Combat. When Combat starts, they automatically return to Terastal form as a Free Action.
________________


Tinker: The user carries a ramshackle weapon made from metal scraps. This weapon does not take up the user’s Held Item slot, and in all ways is considered an extension of themselves: it cannot be removed unwillingly by any means, such as Knock Off or Trick. Once per day as an Extended Action, the user may modify their weapon. The user gains access to an Adept Weapon Move of their choice, as long as it has no limitation against Large Melee Weapons (for example, Salvo may only be used on Ranged Weapons). If the user is level 30 or higher, they may select both an Adept and Master Weapon Move when modifying their weapon, but they may not equip a Held Item if they do so. If the user modifies their weapon, they replace any existing modifications gained this way. Weapon Moves made with a Tinker’s weapon may be Steel-Typed if the user wishes.
NOTE: Weapon Moves never gain STAB.
	



New Keywords and Hazards


Blessing (Updated): As before, but now it’s also used as an Ability keyword. Blessing Abilities work the same as Blessing Moves, and Effects that interact with Blessing Moves interact just the same with either.


Innate (from Data’s Homebrews): Innate Abilities may not be disabled or copied in any way, and Skill Swap fails when used against them. If an Ability has a Bonus, then this keyword will be applied to each separately. If only one portion of an Ability is Innate, then the other part may be disabled, copied (but the copier does not get the Innate part) or Skill Swapped (but the Innate part remains with the original owner).


Slice: Moves with this Keyword involve attacking with a sharpened blade and may be affected by certain effects such as the Sharpness Ability.


Versatile: This move's damage may be calculated with the user's choice of Attack or Special Attack. If the Class of the Move is listed as “Versatile” as well, it always changes to match the chosen Stat.


Wind: Moves with this Keyword produce wind and may be affected by certain effects such as the Wind Power Ability.


Slick Hazards: A Slick Hazard is a special type of Hazard. Any Pokémon or Trainer moving into a Slick Hazard is moved in a straight line, in the direction they entered, ignoring Movement Capabilities, until they are in a square that no longer contains a Slick Hazard, or they would be moved into a square they cannot enter. Foes must then end their Shift, and become Vulnerable for 1 full round. Slick Hazards affect larger Pokémon even if they are only partially standing on them. Foes standing on Slick Hazards may not Jump.

________________


Updated Abilities
Several old Abilities have been updated as part of this project, due to their performance in PTU Version 1.05 not measuring up to the Ability tiers they’re often found in. Doing so made them more viable choices to give to new Pokémon, and thus influenced the decision-making involved with selecting Abilities throughout parts of this project. These can be considered optional if all you’re after is a Gen 9 Dex with indices for new Moves and Abilities.


Ability: Blessed Touch

Effect: The target gains three Ticks of temporary Hit Points, and their next Move cannot miss.

Non-Canon Moves


The document also includes completely new Moves that assist in filling out areas of Pokémon Movesets that are lacking, since the official games don’t provide options for things such as low power Physical Fairy Moves. These Moves are marked with an asterisk (*) next to their names. Many of them are Type-shifts of existing Moves, with the original Move they’re based on included in [Square Brackets]. Since a lot of Pokémon may appreciate these Moves, we recommend treating them like TM/Tutor Moves similar to those added with the Isle of Armour expansion. These include:

Disorient* - Dark [Confusion]
Wither* - Dark [New]
Draco Jet* - Dragon [Quick Attack]
Redline* - Dragon [New]
Butterfly Knife* - Fairy [Fury Cutter]

Dragon Moves

NOTE: As mentioned in the Introduction, some of these moves conditionally deal Super Effective Damage, this is a design idea coming from Domovoi’s Dragon Rework. We recommend using this Rework and fully adapting all Dragon Moves to that. But if you do not use that homebrew supplement, consider removing these Super Effectiveness clauses from your game, especially if you have other houserules in use that already help Dragons with their inability to consistently deal Effective damage.
