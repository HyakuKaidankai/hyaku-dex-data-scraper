# Scrapable Pokedex files

.TXT files that are **mostly** the same as their PDF counterparts. These files were obtained by running the original PDF files through pdf-to-txt converters, and selecting the ones that were the easiest to read line-by-line and identify the relevant data.

They are **mostly** the same not only because some information and structure was lost on the conversion, but because there are some minor things that were deleted or modified so that some tedious edge cases could be avoided. If you are planning to use these files for some other purpose, please be aware of this.
